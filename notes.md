If the account is personal and private, Instagram’s official Graph API does not provide access to followers and following data for private or personal accounts. Direct scraping or automation for this data is also against Instagram's policies. However, there are still ways to approach this responsibly:

1. Manual Export and Import
Export your followers and following lists manually: Instagram provides a way to download your account data, including a list of your followers and the accounts you follow.
Go to Instagram Settings > Privacy and Security > Download Data.
Request your data, and Instagram will send you a link to download a JSON file containing your followers and following information.
Analyze the data programmatically: Use Python or another programming language to compare the followers and following lists from the downloaded data.
Advantages:

100% compliant with Instagram's terms.
No automation or bot risk.
2. Build a Local Tool
Develop a tool that operates locally on your computer to:

Import the downloaded JSON files of followers and following.
Analyze and identify users who don’t follow you back.
Steps to Build:

Parse the downloaded JSON files to extract the followers and following lists.
Compare the two lists to find:
People you follow but who don't follow you back.
People who follow you but you don't follow back.
Display results or export them as a CSV file.
3. Avoid Automation for Account Actions
If you identify users to unfollow:

Manually unfollow them via the Instagram app.
Automating unfollows through bots or scripts is risky and could lead to account bans.

1. Manual Unfollow with Assistive Tools
You can use tools that assist in managing your unfollow process without directly automating it. Here's how:

A. Generate a List with Direct Links
Modify your tool to output a clickable list of user profiles identified for unfollowing.
Example: Export a CSV file with links to the user profiles.
How it works:
Your tool generates a list like this:
csv
Copy
Edit
Username, Profile Link
user1, https://www.instagram.com/user1/
user2, https://www.instagram.com/user2/
You can then click these links and manually unfollow them.
B. Use Browser Extensions
Some browser extensions can help autofill or navigate to profiles, but you must perform the actual "unfollow" action manually.
Example: Extensions that let you click through a list of URLs efficiently.
